This repository is my first exercis in Git at Azubi Africa.

It has been exciting learning Git and Github

The repository contains python files namely:

1. Intro_to_Datatypes- Here I was learning the different data types in python

2. Dictionaries: I have learnt about dictionaries which are key value pairs, have parenthesis and are mutable.

3. Todo_Alaska_foodcost: This is a todo submission that calculates the total cost of purchasing food at Alaska restaurant.

Learning Git has been fun. Thanks to the teacher William, who came through when I reached out for help.
