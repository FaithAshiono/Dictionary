This repository is my first exercise in Git at Azubi Africa.

It has been exciting learning Git and Github

The repository contains Python files, namely:

1. Intro_to_Datatypes: Here I was learning the different data types in python

2. Dictionaries: I have learned about dictionaries that are key-value pairs, have parenthesis, and are mutable.

3. Todo_Alaska_foodcost: This is a todo submission that calculates the total cost of purchasing food at Alaska restaurant.

4. Azubi_store_code.py: This is a todo submission on lists in python and making analysis of the data provided.

Learning Git has been fun. Thanks to the teacher William, who came through when I reached out for help.
